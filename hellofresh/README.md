# HelloFresh Data Science Challenge

## How to run the code

Run all scripts from the root directory. Ideally, run the scripts in the following order:

1. python scripts/model_revaluation.py
2. python scripts/predict.py

To run data exploration script: python data_exploration/eda.py<br />
To run unit tests: python scripts/unit_test.py<br />

## Project Structure

data_exploration/
    - contains a script to explore data and generate some plots<br />
    - also contains plots/figures generated by this script<br />
<br />
db/
    - Mock database<br />
    - holds the input CSVs, the trained model and final predictions for new recipes<br />
<br />
scripts/
    - database.py:<br />
        - a general interface for data I/O<br />
    - model_revaluation.py:<br />
        - used to generate a new model based on data available so far<br />
        - if the average score of new metric is worse than before, we discard the new model.<br />
    - predict.py:<br />
        - used to generate bin predictions for new recipes.<br />
        - predictions generated saved in db/predictions.csv<br />
    - unit_test.py:<br />
        - a unit test for *extract_main_ingredient* function used by both <br />model_revaluation.py and predict.py<br />

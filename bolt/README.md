The goal of the task is to understand your strengths in the data science process. The home task consists of a problem that is similar to our day-to-day work. We will share a synthetic dataset with you and a task description, and we expect you to submit a rendered notebook showing your work. 

 

We will evaluate:

The quality of your exploratory data analysis
The coherence and structure of your ideas and code
Your modeling approach, training, and validation methodology
The applicability of your modeling technique to the real-life task you are trying to solve
Your take on how the impact of the model should be evaluated in real-world interactions with our user base

Efficient supply allocation

The success of Bolt as a ride-hailing platform depends on a marketplace or efficient matching supply and demand in real-time. There are two sides in a ride-hailing marketplace: riders (demand) and drivers (supply). One of the challenges that we aim to solve is efficient supply allocation, so riders can always get a ride and drivers have stable earnings. Knowledge about how demand changes over time and space is crucial to comprehend supply dynamics. 

 

For this test task we expect you to:

 

Explore the data and suggest a solution to guide the drivers towards areas with higher expected demand at given time and location
Build and document a baseline model for your solution
Describe how you would design and deploy such a model
Describe how to communicate model recommendations to drivers
Think through and describe the design of the experiment  that would validate your solution for live operations taking into account marketplace specifics
The goal of the task is to understand your strengths in the data science fundamentals and product thinking.

Data for the task:
The source data is approximately 630000 rows of synthetic ride demand data which resembles the real-life situation in the city of Tallinn:

start_time - time when the order was made
start_lat - latitude of the order's pick-up point
start_lng - longitude of the order's pick-up point
end_lat - latitude of the order's destination point
end_lng - longitude of the order's destination point
ride_value - how much monetary value is in this particular ride

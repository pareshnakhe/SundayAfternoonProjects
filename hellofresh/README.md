# HelloFresh Data Science Challenge

## How to run the code

Run all scripts from the root directory. Ideally, run the scripts in the following order:
1. python scripts/model_revaluation.py
2. python scripts/predict.py

To run data exploration script: python data_exploration/eda.py
To run unit tests: python scripts/unit_test.py

## Project Structure

data_exploration/
- contains a script to explore data and generate some plots
- also contains plots/figures generated by this script

db/
- Mock database<br  />
- holds the input CSVs, the trained model and final predictions for new recipes

scripts/<br  />
- database.py:
	- a general interface for data I/O
- model_revaluation.py:
	- used to generate a new model based on data available so far
	- if the average score of new metric is worse than before, we discard the new model.
- predict.py:
	- used to generate bin predictions for new recipes.
	- predictions generated saved in db/predictions.csv
- unit_test.py:
	- a unit test for *extract_main_ingredient* function used by both model_revaluation.py and predict.py

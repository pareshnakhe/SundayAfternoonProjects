# Predict Consumer Purchases

This a toy problem I came across on a site (don't want to mention the source). It belongs to a class of problems I don't have much experience with. Although the solution is not very sophisticated, I do think there are some nice ideas in it. This mini-project is meant to document it.

> The data set attached to this task contains the purchase histories (i.e., shopping baskets) of 2,000 consumers over 49 weeks across 5 categories (​train.csv​). In simulating the basket data we assumed that consumers only buy one unit of a product in a given week. The data set also contains the price consumers paid for one unit of product j in week t and a boolean variable that indicates whether the purchased product was advertised (1) or not (0). We also provide the week 50 promotion schedule (discounts and advertising) for all products (​promotion_schedule.csv​).

> The Task:
> Use the data to build a ML model for consumer purchases. With the trained model, predict week 50 purchases for all 80,000 possible consumer-product combinations (40 products x 2,000 consumers) in the data. Provide your predictions as a ​.csv file (cf. ​prediction_example.csv​) that contains the columns i (consumer), j (product), and prediction. Model performance will be evaluated using AUC score​.
